# React-App---Import-Reddit-feed-and-show-a-list

This is a test App i made when learning React. 
The App imports a chosen Reddit feed from a JSON and shows it in a list. 
It also loads the comments and uses pagination to navigate through the list.

You can check out the App live here: http://weibenfalk.com/react_reddit/

You have to setup a local server to run this code. I use Create-React-App via npm.
